This is my first post on the grid. I can talk about what I want. 

I could talk about my christmas presents, my house and everything else. For instance, sharing the joy of the new year to come with the rest of the world. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/70a70a58-c9b5-41dd-a228-b8dc074392ca.jpg)

This is my and my Mr. Flibble. He drinks lead paint. We went to a Xmas party last week organised by the company I work at. We went as Mr. Frost and Miss Ice Queen. Some people in my family say we look scary... Really?
